# How to deploy a React JS application In Tomcat 

Deploy React JS app in Tomcat

<h3>A strange behavior is noticed, if I run the app in web pack dev server same code works fine and routers works fine as well.
But same behavior is not observed once I deploy to tomcat.

So after a lot of research and thinking, i  got the solution. As you know BrowserRouter uses HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with URL.So, For example, if you used React Router with a route for,/todos/42 the webpack development server will respond properlylocalhost:3000/todos/42,
but a production build as above will not.Check out this link to understand the problem. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41246261/react-routing-is-able-to-handle-different-url-path-but-tomcat-returns-404-not-av/41249464#41249464.
